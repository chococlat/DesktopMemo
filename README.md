# DesktopMemo

![enter image description here](https://github.com/chococlat/DesktopMemo/blob/main/demo.gif)

The foundation of this app is lightness and portability. The notes are printed directly on the desktop background, and once the app is closed they remain there. This way you can always see the notes without there being a resource-consuming background app.

## At the moment the possible options are:

- Adding notes, in different colors
- Clearing all the notes with a button
- Setting a base desktop canvas for the notes to be printed.
- Hiding all the notes, for privacy reasons

## Known Limitations

The app is currently working properly only in this precise setup:

- You must have a static wallpaper, not a slideshow, not a solid color.
- If you want the notes to allign with the preview you need to use a 1920x1080 monitor.
- If you have more monitors you cant use them to add the notes, even though they will appear after you added them in your main monitor.

All of these problems will be solved as soon as i see that people want to use the app. I created the app for my setup, so if i am the only one using it i dont really care to change it.

## Possible future features

- The ability to remove notes one by one
- The ability to change the font
- The ability to change the size of the note
- The ability to draw on the notes
- A complete management windows to move and edit the notes

## Setup

- Download the whole folder and put it wherever you want
- Run DesktopMemo.exe


## Troubleshooting

If you have any error popping up follow these steps:

- Close the app
- Remove these files if you find them:
  - ft
  - Any file named Default.(any format)
- Set your wallpaper again in the windows settings
- Reopen the app
