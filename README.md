# DesktopMemo

The foundation of this app is lightness and portability. The notes are printed directly on the desktop background, and once the app is closed they remain there. This way you can always see the notes without there being a resource-consuming background app.

### At the moment the possible options are:

- Adding notes, in different colors
- Clearing all the notes with a button
- Setting a base desktop canvas for the notes to be printed.
- Hiding all the notes, for privacy reasons

### Future upgrades

- The ability to remove notes one by one
- The ability to change the font
- The ability to change the size of the note
- The ability to draw on the notes
- A complete management windows to move and edit the notes
